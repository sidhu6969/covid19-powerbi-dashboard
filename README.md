# COVID-19 Power BI Dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
I used a large COVID-19 dataset, split it into 5 structured tables using SQL, and imported them into Power BI to create a dynamic and insightful dashboard.

## ðŸ”§ Steps:
1. Cleaned and normalized the raw dataset using SQL
2. Split into 5 tables: `Cases`, `Deaths`, `Vaccinations`, `Locations`, `Dates`
3. Exported tables to Excel and imported into Power BI
4. Built a dashboard with slicers, cards, and line graphs

## ðŸ“Ž Files:
- `covidproject.pbix` â€“ Main Power BI dashboard file
- Screenshots folder (optional)

## ðŸ§  Key Insights:
- Country-wise and location-wise trends
- Vaccination vs death comparison
- Time-based filters and slicers
